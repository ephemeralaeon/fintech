    * Achieve market-differentiating pricing sophistication
        * Many countries are rightly trending toward requiring companies to provide explanations of any automated decision that impacts an individual person. Leveraging our Explainability capability, insurance service providers can deploy AI-powered pricing algorithms that contribute to the compliance with these new filing and regulatory requirements
    
* Customer: EAI OS for Insurance

* Marketsize: Global Insurtech Market revenue is valued at 5.48 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach 10.14 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 10.80% during the period 2019-2025. The insurance industry with global premiums exceeding US 4.9 trillion dollars in 2017, is one of the most complex businesses around. Although late, the industry now appears to be at a key inflection point with many experts viewing the digitization of insurance as the next big opportunity after FinTech.

### Tecnologies
* Technologies
    * Optical Character Recognitiomn: Instantly transcribe text from natural environments or digital documents, reducing manual work and enabling automatic workflows.

    * Time Series Forecasting: Best-in-class AI-powered forecasting provides better accuracy and can deliver lift for a wide range of forecasting scenarios, across multiple industries.

    * Optimization: AI-powered optimization boosts the efficiency of business processes and tasks, maximizing lift and ROI compared to traditional optimization methods.
    
    * Explainability: Making your AI explainable to users helps drive adoption and lowers the barrier of entry for users.
    
    * Recommender System: Use past data and actions to recommend the best choices to users in complex situations, driving better and faster decision-making in a workflow-specific context.
    
    * Anomaly Detection: Detect anomalies on objects in natural environments and in various types of data, such as logs, video feeds and sales data, allowing for real-time reaction to these events.
    
    * Text Extraction and Analysis: Accelerate the work of extracting insights from multiple forms of textual data and catch signals that are easily overlooked by humans with techniques such as sentiment analysis and text summarization.
    

## Landscape:


Overall target words, artificial intelligence, new talents, investor-like vision, but with the technological progress of the past year, Saraya Hitoya was born. Cournoyer Shoyo AI Co., Ltd. 3 types:

* Applied Artificial Intelligence

    * This represents most technology companies and artificial intelligence with artificial intelligence. Contrary to consumer metaphors, similar to the added meaning of AI, personalized special teapots. This is the most common company in the world.<br/><br/> 
    
* AI First

    * Such companies promote business with technological upgrades, and in order to optimize their competitiveness, promote artificial intelligence to the top position. The AI First solution will change the way humans interact with software/machines, from passive relationships (we tell machines what to do) to point-to-point relationships (machines predict our needs and make recommendations when we interact with them), and ultimately form active relationships ( The machine tells us what/when/how to do based on a series of inputs and expected results).<br/><br/> 

    * The first two types of companies can continuously train their own artificial intelligence algorithms through the use of customers to make AI smarter and thus provide better services. The products of these companies are different due to personalization. For example, the founders of Element AI have invested in Ross Intelligence, a company that provides users with artificial intelligence lawyer services.<br/><br/> 
    
    * Ross Intelligence belongs to the category of AI First, and they provide users with tools that can help lawyers work more efficiently. Among them, artificial intelligence plays a central role, and every lawyer who uses it will train the artificial intelligence system to investigate and judge the case. This will not only improve the efficiency of lawyers, but also allow artificial intelligence to continuously improve its own accuracy. As companies like Ross Intelligence grow, perhaps in the future, law firms may no longer need investigative assistants because artificial intelligence has taken over their work. <br/><br/> 
    
    * Another typical case is MindBridge, headquartered in Ottawa. One of the founders of this company was an early employee of IBM Watson. Their products can help auditors more easily detect potentially fraudulent transactions. When you enter data into their system, this tool can mark all suspected fraudulent areas, which are marked as red, yellow, or green, for auditors to carefully review and ultimately determine which are the real frauds. This process also allows artificial intelligence to learn continuously. The company estimates that in the future, human auditors will only need to spend five minutes on each transaction. Mindbridge has a longer-term vision: everything will be audited in real time, and if the system finds that there is a risk of fraud in a transaction, it will be warned in advance, which is a big step forward compared to the traceability of fraud. <br/><br/> 
    
* The Machine

    * These companies build a full range of artificial intelligence systems. Just like the super technology companies we often see in science fiction movies, they have strong strengths that can make the impossible possible. Now, technology giants like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple and Baidu are very close to this concept. They are constantly improving the solutions of artificial intelligence systems (distributed, centralized, local or cloud), infiltrating every device of users. They are doing everything for us, providing us with various suggestions, just like "Skynet" described in the movie "Terminator".<br/><br/> 

## Results

### Impact

The presence of the forerunner not only means that there is the experience for reference, but also that Element AI is facing strong competitive pressure from its Silicon Valley rivals. But if you look at the various cities and markets, you will find that Montreal is becoming the center of artificial intelligence in North America. This Canadian city is indeed shaking the position of Silicon Valley, gathering more and more startups and capital. At the same time, the Toronto-Waterloo area in Canada is also fighting for the same position. No matter which city wins in the end, the purpose of Canadians becoming the world's leading country in artificial intelligence will become a reality. At present, Element AI plans to open a new branch in Toronto, which will be their second office. The company has regarded the two cities as the same market.

If you lead a team of 20 PhDs in Silicon Valley, you will soon receive 5 million dollars in the financing, which is considered a natural thing; however, in Canada, things have not developed to this point. Startups are underestimated. Nevertheless, there are many innovative technology companies in Toronto, such as Kindred, which builds humanoid robots, Layer6.ai, which provides personalized deep learning recommendation systems, etc. In addition, there are dozens of small companies with great growth potential.

### Impact

As an investor, Element AI believes that new technology giants will inevitably emerge in the explosion of artificial intelligence, because the industrial chain of machine intelligence is not yet complete. At present, Intel and Nvidia are leading companies in artificial intelligence hardware technology, but the artificial intelligence chips they provide are still an extension of CPU/GPU, not native design. The new company has room for development in this regard. Cournoyer believes that in the future Within 10 to 15 years, new giants will emerge.

The presence of the forerunner not only means that there is the experience for reference, but also that Element AI is facing strong competitive pressure from its Silicon Valley rivals.

At present, Element AI plans to open a new branch in Toronto, which will be their second office. The company has regarded the two cities as the same market.

If you lead a team of 20 PhDs in Silicon Valley, you will soon receive 5 million dollars in the financing, which is considered a natural thing; however, in Canada, things have not developed to this point. Startups are underestimated. Nevertheless, there are many innovative technology companies in Toronto, such as Kindred, which builds humanoid robots, Layer6.ai, which provides personalized deep learning recommendation systems, etc. In addition, there are dozens of small companies with great growth potential.

## Recommendations

Firstly, I would recommend Element AI to add advisory bot to their product solutions. most customers of insurance needs a lot of consultation and computation from the insurance sales. However, with natual language processing technology, the role can be replaced by robots. Customers, besides purchasing commercial insurance, can have clearer view in life-time returns calculations. Secondly, I would recommend to adopt internet of things technologies in risk evaluation of persons. This will allow insurance company have more data to evaluate individual's risk preference which can assist more customized insurance plan and returns.
